The files in this folder belong to the Semster Project "Navigation on an implicit Voronoi diagram"
of Christian Gehring and Yves Pilat. 

The code can be found on https://aslforge.ethz.ch/projects/voronavigation/.

Because the navigation method was tested with the robot robox, 
the launch files are stored here.

Have a look at the launch file robox_vn_start.launch to start the navigation controller with the SMP version on robox.
A joystick is needed to start the controller by pressing the second button. Press the first button to stop it.

The robox_vn_start.launch is not very convenient, because rviz crashes sometimes. 
Use rather the launch file /rviz/robox_rviz.launch to start rviz separately.
